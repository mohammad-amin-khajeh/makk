## Software

{{put_image(path='/images/desktop.png' caption='<em>My fast and efficient workflow which I will never let go of.</em>' )}}

- **OS**: I used to use windows until I got a bite of linux and could never go back.
 Currently I use [Arch linux](https://archlinux.org/) which I have found to be the most convenient distro for me as it allows me to just get job done.
  - **Window manager**: [dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) is what I use to hop between my windows at the speed of thought. It has a learning curve but it's so worth it in my opinion. It's also pretty light and fast.
- **Text editor**: [Neovim](https://github.com/mohammad-amin-khajeh/lazyvim) is what I use for all my text editing/programming/taking notes etc. Much like dwm it has a learning curve(even ***steeper*** than dwm) but again it is so worth it in my opinion.
- **File manager**: [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/), I used to use [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) previously but yazi is so much better.
- **Terminal**: [st-flexipatch](https://github.com/mohammad-amin-khajeh/st) is pretty much the fastest terminal emulator that I have found so far. With the patches that I have applied it has all the goodies of modern terminal yet is blazingly fast and light.
- **Browser**: Firefox is my web browser of choice. Although with a custom user.js file based on [betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox).

## Hardware

- I use an [Ideapad slim 3](https://psref.lenovo.com/Product/IdeaPad/IdeaPad_Slim_3_15IRU8) with 8gb of ram and a 13th gen i3 processor.
- I do ***not***  use a mouse or a separate keyboard. Just the laptop itself as is.
