## Software

{{put_image(path='/images/desktop.png' caption='<em>My fast and efficient workflow which I will never let go of.</em>' )}}

- **OS**: I used to use windows until I got a bite of Linux and could never go back.
 Currently I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) which I have found to be one of the few distros that actually gets out of my way and allows me to get job done.
- **Window manager**: [dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) is what I use to hop between my windows at the speed of thought. It has a learning curve but it's so worth it in my opinion. It's also pretty light and fast. My config is available on github but you really shouldn't use it since it's tailored to my needs and packages and other configs; I suggest crafting your own experience(takes a few hours at most provided you have basic knowledge of Linux).
- **Text editor**: [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is what I use for all my text editing/programming/taking notes etc. Much like dwm it has a learning curve(even ***steeper*** than dwm) but again it is very worth it in my opinion. You can find my config [here](https://github.com/mohammad-amin-khajeh/lazyvim).
- **File manager**: [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/), I used to use [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) previously but yazi is so much better.
- **Terminal**: [st-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/st-flexipatch) is pretty much the fastest terminal emulator that I have found so far and with the patches that I have applied it has all the goodies of modern terminals yet is blazingly fast and light. Again, you can find my config [here](https://github.com/mohammad-amin-khajeh/st).
- **Browser**: Firefox is my web browser of choice. With a custom user.js file based on [betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) that is.
- **Music player**: I actually don't use spotify or apple music is any of those services. I listen to music offline with [cmus](https://github.com/cmus/cmus) on Linux and [musicolet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.krosbits.musicolet&hl=en_US) on android.
- **This website**: I used [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to create this website. It's a pretty fast and simple static site generator and you can get going with it in a single day if you're savvy enough. The theme I'm using is called [kita](https://github.com/st1020/kita).

## Hardware

- I use an [Ideapad slim 3](https://psref.lenovo.com/Product/IdeaPad/IdeaPad_Slim_3_15IRU8) with 8gb of ram and a 13th gen i3 processor.
- I do ***not***  use a mouse or a separate keyboard. Just the laptop itself as is.
