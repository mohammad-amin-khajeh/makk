## English stress accent

English stress accent refers to the emphasis placed on certain syllables in words and certain words in sentences. The stressed syllables are pronounced louder, longer, and with a higher pitch compared to unstressed syllables. This pattern helps distinguish meaning and structure in English.

There are two main types of stress:

1. ### Word stress

In multi-syllable words, one syllable is stressed more than the others.  
For example:
    - *RE*cord (noun) vs. re*CORD* (verb) The placement of stress can change the meaning of the word.

2. ### Sentence stress

In sentences, content words like nouns, main verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are stressed, while function words like articles, auxiliary verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions are typically unstressed.  
For example:
    - I am *GO*ing to the store. (stressed: "going")

## Japanese pitch accent

Japanese pitch accent refers to the way the pitch (**high** or **low**) of syllables in a word can change its meaning. Unlike English stress accent, which focuses on loudness and duration, Japanese pitch accent is about the relative pitch of syllables within a word.

In Japanese, the duration of each sound that makes up a word (known as a 'mora') is the same, and only the pitch varies.

### To exemplify

| Japanese | Romaji | English |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 箸 | ***HA***shi | chopsticks |
| 橋 | ha***SHI*** | bridge |
| 端 | ha***SHI*** | edge |

- ## Stress modifies

  - volume
  - length
  - pitch

- ## Pitch accent modifies

  - ~volume~
  - ~length~
  - pitch

## All about morae

In phonology, syllables are like cars and morae are like people.

Every car on the road must contain at least one person (the driver), but a car can also contain multiple people. Likewise, every syllable contains minimally one mora, but it may contain two or even three.

In order to understand morae better let's have a look at hiragana:

While it is common to refer to hiragana and katakana as syllabaries, a more precise characterization would describe them as moraic scripts.

### Counting morae

| Hiragana/Katakana | Romaji    | Mora Count | Syllable Count |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| ないよう          | naiyou    | 4          | 2              |
| ようかい          | youkai    | 4          | 2              |
| さべつ            | sabetsu   | 3          | 3              |
| モーラ            | mōra      | 3          | 2              |
| エラー            | erā       | 3          | 2              |
| はか              | haka      | 2          | 2              |
| さけ              | sake      | 2          | 2              |
