## Isn't it distracting?
Not at all. Well, at least not for me; I initially thought I'm the *odd* one for listening to music while coding because it *"takes you out of the flow state"* but as it turns out for a lot of fellow coders it's quite the opposite.

I listen to music while solving leetcode or working on projects or anything in between. But here's the thing, a lot of the times I don't even think about what is playing in my ears because I'm so focused on the task at hand.

*"But doesn't that make the music pointless?"* I hear you ask.

No, not really. As a matter of fact Music, in this context, is __a means to another end__.

I don't know about you but silence drives me crazy, I can hardly sleep in silence[^1]

With coding it's a similar story. Music allows me to lose myself in the work at hand and stay in the state of flow for hours[^2].

Without it I feel like there's something missing and I'm more conscious of my environment which is not good.

## What sort of music do I listen to while coding?

Whatever I feel like it, but most of the time something instrumental or just anything without lyrics.

But there are two main genres which I listen to a lot:
  - Atmospheric/ambient black metal
  - Vaporwave/smooth jazz

Don't let the "black metal" in it scare you away it's actually pretty nice.

Here are some starter albums in no particular order to get you hooked:

## Summary
In the end, you do you. I hope I was able to show you a new perspective as regards coding environment. Go ahead and experiment with it and see if it works for you or not.
