Aspiring software engineer with a huge passion for learning and building stuff(also a **Huge** Linux geek).

This website is meant to be my comfortable little corner on the internet where I rant and post and teach, sometimes in English, sometimes in Farsi, sometimes in both.

You can hit me up in my socials at the footer.
