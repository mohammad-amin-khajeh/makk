besides their ladies, was that they had that suit of armor,
you know, and they couldn’t get hurt very easy.
No cars in those days, you know? No drunk teenagers to tear into your a#@.”

> “But sometimes they suffocated in all that armor, Mel.
They’d even have heart attacks if it got too hot and they were too tired and worn out.
I read somewhere that they’d fall off their horses and not be able to get up because they were too tired to stand with all that armor on them.
They got trampled by their own horses sometimes.”

> “Sometimes I think I’ll go up there dressed like a beekeeper.
You know, that hat that’s like a helmet with the plate that comes down over your face,
the big gloves, and the padded coat?
I’ll knock on the door and let loose a hive of bees in the house.
But first I’d make sure the kids were out, of course.”
