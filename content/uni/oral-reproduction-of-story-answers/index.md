## Summarized summary

Two couples and friends were sitting around the main character's kitchen table, drinking gin and enjoying each other's company.

Somehow they ended up on the topic of love.
From there on, our MC and his wife carry the bulk of the conversation, talking about their past experience as regards love and what true love is.

From an abusive ex-husband who "<u>***loved***</u>" his at the time wife, to an elderly couple in their 70s whose honeymoon phase seemingly never ended.

## Characters

- Nick, the narrator

Nick, the narrator of the story, doesn’t say much, but the observations and physical movements he makes are key to revealing what love means to the four friends gathered at the table.\
Nick speaks up only four times during most of the conversation, twice to ask questions, once to suggest that love is absolute, and finally to say that he and Laura are lucky.\
At the end of the story, however, his own words begin sounding as jumbled as Mel’s, such as when he suggests that they either eat or keep drinking and when he makes a joke about heading “right on out into the sunset.”\
None of Nick’s comments are especially revelatory; more significant are the things he doesn’t say out loud.\
For example, his narration includes comments on the weakening sunlight in the room, an observation that reveals how muddled the friends’ ideas of love eventually become.\
He also touches Laura a great deal, holding and kissing her hand and touching her leg under the table.\
These are genuinely affectionate gestures and suggest that even though the friends may talk about love all night, their words don’t really matter in the end.\
Finally, Nick is the only one who can “hear everyone’s heart,” which suggests that he may have insight into love that the others do not.

- Laura, Nick's wife

- Mel[vin], a cardiologist and the main character

The first thing we learn about Mel McGinnis is that he’s a cardiologist—a heart doctor. Of the four characters in the story, Mel, by virtue of his profession, would seem to be the one most likely to have some insight into matters of the heart. Indeed, he talks more than anyone else about love and has the strongest opinions. Yet despite the fact that Mel talks a lot, he doesn’t seem to know more than anyone else about love.\
As he keeps drinking and talking, his strong statements blur into confusing ramblings that don’t seem to make much of a point.\
He knows the story about the elderly couple is important, but he can’t explain exactly why.\
He knows his thoughts about past and future loves are meaningful, but the way he describes them makes him sound confused and nonsensical.\
And his apparent desire to kill his ex-wife with swarms of bees suggests that, far from being an expert on love, Mel knows absolutely nothing about it.

- Terri, Mel's wife

Although no one in “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” seems to have a firm idea of what love really is, Terri does have some extreme and somewhat disturbing opinions.\
One of the most detailed tales told around the table is of Terri’s former lover, Ed, who was terribly abusive and threatened both her and Mel.\
Mel is firm in his belief that Ed was crazy, but Terri insists that Ed truly loved her.\
She points out that Ed tried to kill himself by swallowing rat poison when she left him and, when that didn’t work, shot himself through the mouth.\
Although the others don’t share Terri’s ideas about love, she nevertheless has a more solid idea about love than anyone else in the story.\
While Mel talks of his hatred for his ex-wife and Nick and Laura merely touch each other softly, Terri is the only one who can genuinely say that she once experienced true love.\
Mel calls Terri a member of the “kick-me-so-I’ll-know-you-love-me school,” but no one in the story can articulate a view of love that is clearer or more convincing.

- Ed, Terri's ex-husband

## Themes

- The elusive nature of love

The nature of love remains elusive throughout “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,” despite the characters’ best efforts to define it.\
Mel tries again and again to pinpoint the meaning of love, but his examples never build up to any coherent conclusion.\
For example, he tells his friends about an elderly couple who nearly died in a car crash, but the conclusion of the story—the old man depressed by not being able to see his wife—merely confuses everyone.\
When he asserts that he’ll tell everyone exactly what love is, he instead digresses into a muddled meditation about how strange it is that he and the others have loved more than one person.\
His attempts to clarify the nature of love eventually devolve into a bitter tirade against his ex-wife.\
He seems much more certain about what love is not and tells Terri several times that if abusive love is true love, then she “can have it.”

Laura and Nick believe that they know what love is, but they never really provide a clear definition or explain why they’re so certain in their convictions.\
They merely demonstrate their love for each other by blushing and holding hands, but these actions simply support the mystery of love rather than unmask it.\
Terri, of all the friends, seems to be most certain about the meaning of love and repeatedly claims that her abusive ex-boyfriend, Ed, truly loved her, despite his crazy way of showing it.\
The examples she provides of this love—beating, stalking, and threatening—are disturbing but serve as proof in her mind.\
Like the others, however, she cannot translate her certainty into any kind of clear explanation of the nature of love.

- The Duality of love
- The Inadequacy of Language

Although the four friends talk for a while about love, the fact that they never manage to define it suggests that language can’t adequately describe emotional, abstract subjects.\
Mel does the most talking, but his bloated stories and rambling digressions show that he has trouble conveying his thoughts and feelings, despite how much he talks.\
Terri speaks a great deal about her former lover Ed, but when Mel challenges her, she turns to intuition to prove her point.\
She believes that Ed loved her no matter what Mel or the others think, demonstrating that gut feelings about love can be more powerful and accurate than words.\
Laura and Nick, meanwhile, say very little about the nature of love and instead rely on physical gestures to clarify what language cannot: they hold hands, blush, and touch each other’s legs.\
Carver indicates that words simply aren’t enough when talking about love, which is probably why all four friends have fallen silent by the end of the story.

## Style

- Dirty realism

The dirty-realism school of writing became popular in the 1980s thanks to a group of writers who began writing about middle-class characters who faced disappointments, heartbreaks, and harsh truths in their ordinary lives.\
Granta, a highly regarded literary journal, coined the term dirty realism in 1983 when it published its eighth issue, which featured writers from this school.\
Granta 8, as the issue became known, included stories by Angela Carter, Bobbie Ann Mason, Richard Ford, Tobias Wolff, Raymond Carver, and many others.\
Although each of these dirty-realism writers has a distinctive style, they are connected by their sparse prose, simple language with few adjectives or adverbs and direct descriptions of ordinary people and events.\
Much of the fiction published in the New Yorker, where many of these writers were and are still published, is of the dirty-realism school, but today the term—as well as the practice—has somewhat fallen out of fashion.\
“What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” was published in 1981, at the height of the dirty-realism movement, and the story is often regarded as the prime example of the form.

## Quotes & Symbolism

- ## Mel is more confused than anyone else

> “the terrible thing, the terrible thing is, but the good thing too, the saving grace, you might say,
is that if something happened to one of us—excuse me for saying this—but if something happened to one of us tomorrow,
I think the other one, the other person, would grieve for a while,
you know, but then the surviving party would go out and love again, have someone else soon enough.”
>
> — Mel

Mel makes this comment roughly halfway through the story, after he has told everyone that he’ll explain to them what love really is.\
Far from clarifying the matter,\
Mel instead points out what he considers to be love’s greatest mysteries—where love goes when one person stops loving the other and how it’s possible to fall in love again with someone new.\
Mel says that he knows he used to love Marjorie, his ex-wife, even though he hates her now, and he points out that Terri, Nick, and Laura have all loved other people in their pasts as well.\
Mel is genuinely disturbed by the mysteries he voices here; he doesn’t even know whether what he says is “terrible” or the “saving grace.”\
At the beginning of the story, we learn that Mel believes love is spiritual and spent five years in a seminary.\
Mel’s comments also mark a turning point in the discussion about love as the discussion becomes more serious and intense for him,\
despite the fact that he later claims that the four are all “just talking.”\
This quotation reveals Mel’s struggle to understand love and his fear that love is less permanent than he would like to believe.

- ## Love is inevitable

> “But what I liked about knights,
besides their ladies, was that they had that suit of armor,
you know, and they couldn’t get hurt very easy.
No cars in those days, you know? No drunk teenagers to tear into your a#@.”

>
> “But sometimes they suffocated in all that armor, Mel.
They’d even have heart attacks if it got too hot and they were too tired and worn out.
I read somewhere that they’d fall off their horses and not be able to get up because they were too tired to stand with all that armor on them.
They got trampled by their own horses sometimes.”

Even after he found out that his wife was going to pull through, he was still very depressed.
Not about the accident, though.
I mean, the accident was one thing, but it wasn’t everything.
I’d get up to his mouth- hole, you know, and he’d say no, it wasn’t the accident exactly but it was because he couldn’t see her through his eye-holes.
He said that was what was making him feel so bad. Can you imagine? I’m telling you, the man’s heart was breaking because he couldn’t turn his goddamn head and ***see*** his goddamn wife.”

- ## The sun

{{admonition(type='info' text="Represents the loss of clarity and happiness as the friends grow increasingly confused about the meaning of love.")}}

The sun in the story, which is bright at the beginning and gone by the end, represents the loss of clarity and happiness as the friends grow increasingly confused about the meaning of love. At the beginning of the story, Nick notes that the kitchen is bright and compares the friends to giddy children who have “agreed on something forbidden.” The talk is light and hopeful, just a friendly conversation on a gin-soaked afternoon. However, as the conversation about love becomes increasingly dark and complex, the sun in the kitchen slips slowly away. Nick notes that the sun is “changing, getting thinner,” and, not long after, that the sun is “draining out of the room.” As the sun disappears completely, the conversation devolves into Mel’s drunken threats against his ex-wife, including a fantasy of murdering her. At the end of the story, the friends are sitting in complete darkness. The sun has gone, as have their rosy, hopeful perceptions of love.
